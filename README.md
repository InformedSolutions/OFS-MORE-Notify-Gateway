# GOV.UK Notify Gateway API

A RESTful web service, enabling integration with the GOV.UK Notify platform over HTTP protocols alone.

## Running the solution
To run the GOV.UK Notify Gateway API you must first pull all python dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Once these dependencies have been gathered, you can run the service itself by issuing the command `python manage.py runserver`. After running this command, the GOV.UK Notify Gateway API will be made available (using the default Django port) on http://localhost:8000.
